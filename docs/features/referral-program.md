# YieldLoop Referral Program

## Overview
The YieldLoop Referral Program provides a simple, transparent, non-financial incentive for users to share the platform. Users receive a referral code after their first completed deposit.

The program offers temporary fee discounts only. It does not pay commissions, distribute tokens, or share platform profit.

---

## Eligibility
A referral code is automatically generated for a user once they complete their first deposit into any YieldLoop 30-day cycle.

The referral code may be shared with new users during signup or initial deposit.

---

## Referral Reward
When a new user signs up and makes their first deposit using a referral code:

**Both the referrer and the referred user receive:**
- **5% discount on the platform performance fee for their next 3 cycles.**

This discount applies only to verified-profit performance fees.

### Stacking Rules
Referral discounts can stack with:
- NFT membership discounts  
- YLP deposit-payment discount  
- Any governance-approved promotional discounts  

A global discount cap may be defined by governance to ensure sustainability.

---

## Program Rules
- The referral reward activates only after the referred user completes their first deposit.
- Each referral grants one 3-cycle discount package.
- Multiple referral rewards stack sequentially (not all at once).
- Referral codes cannot be transferred, resold, or used across multiple self-owned accounts.
- Discounts apply only to platform fees, not to withdrawal fees or gas.

---

## Compliance Notes
The referral program is designed to avoid all forms of financial compensation and investment expectations.

It is compliant because:
- It provides **discounts**, not payouts.  
- It offers no revenue sharing, commissions, or ROI.  
- It does not constitute an investment contract.  
- It functions identically to standard SaaS/e-commerce referral systems.

## Purpose
The referral system encourages organic growth while maintaining full platform sustainability and transparency. Discounts are only applied to actual verified profit, ensuring alignment with YieldLoop’s Verified Finance principles.
