# YieldLoop NFT Program
A Two-Tier Membership System for Supporters & Founders

The YieldLoop NFT Collection is a utility-based membership system designed to help fund the development of the YieldLoop platform and the broader Veridic Finance framework. These NFTs do not represent equity, do not provide governance rights, and do not offer profit-sharing. They unlock utilities and privileges within the platform and community.

This collection consists of two membership levels:

- **Supporter NFTs ($300)**
- **Founder NFTs ($1000)**

Both tiers contribute to building a verified-finance ecosystem, but Founders receive enhanced access and participation benefits.

---

## 1. SUPPORTER NFT — $300

The Supporter NFT serves as the accessible, foundational membership tier for community backers.

### **Utility**
- **5% lifetime discount** on YieldLoop performance fees  
- Access to community channels and updates  
- Recognition as an early participant in the YieldLoop & Veridic ecosystem

### **Characteristics**
- No governance rights  
- No financial or profit-based rights  
- Pure utility and community support role  

Supporter NFTs are designed for users who want platform perks without deeper participation requirements.

## 2. FOUNDER NFT — $1000

The Founder NFT is a premium membership tier designed for individuals who want to be more involved in development cycles, testing, and ecosystem shaping.

### **Utility**
- **10% lifetime discount** on YieldLoop performance fees  
- First access to public testing phases  
- Access to a private Founder Circle channel  
- Ability to participate in structured feedback sessions  
  - (These are **non-governance**, advisory discussions only)  
- Direct communication access for roadmap conversations, Q&A, and structured idea submission  

These benefits are participation-driven and do not imply any employment, governance, or fiduciary role.

## 3. FOUNDER ENGAGEMENT INCENTIVE  
### (0.25% Marketing Incentive Pool)

Founder NFT holders may qualify for a discretionary **Founder Engagement Incentive**, funded exclusively from YieldLoop’s marketing budget.

This is **not** profit-sharing.  
It is **not** tied to platform revenue or performance.  
It is **not guaranteed**.  
It is **not passive income**.

### **Eligibility**
To qualify for distributions, Founder NFT holders must complete engagement requirements such as:
- Participating in tests or feedback cycles  
- Completing surveys or evaluations  
- Helping refine user experience  
- Contributing to founder activity sessions  

Only **active Founder participants** receive incentives. This ensures that the program operates strictly as a **loyalty-based participation reward**, similar to corporate ambassador or creator incentive programs.

## 4. Compliance & Safety Notes

The YieldLoop NFT system is purposely structured to avoid any resemblance to securities, investment contracts, or equity instruments.

### These NFTs:
- Do **not** grant ownership in YieldLoop  
- Do **not** provide rights to revenue, profits, or dividends  
- Do **not** offer governance or voting power  
- Do **not** create expectations of ROI  
- Are **sold as digital memberships** with platform-related utility  

The Founder Engagement Incentive is:
- A **marketing budget allocation**  
- **Not correlated to YieldLoop financial performance**  
- **Participation-based and discretionary**  
- Similar to loyalty rewards, ambassador rewards, or community bounties  

This framework ensures compliance with U.S. and international standards for digital asset utility programs.

## 5. Summary

The YieldLoop NFT Collection enables two types of supporters to join the mission:

### 🟢 **Supporters ($300)**

### 🟣 **Founders ($1000)**
