# Preface

YieldLoop is designed for people who want simple, automated financial growth while contributing to real-world innovation. It is accessible to both crypto users and traditional fiat users.

The platform uses an automated trading engine that executes high-frequency, low-risk trades on assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. Verified profits are distributed to users in $LOOP, the platform’s performance-backed token.

Users can choose:

- **Compound All** (auto-grow)
- **Split 50/50** (withdraw half)
- **Collect All** (withdraw full profit)

A performance fee is charged **only on profit**, never deposits.  
Part of that fee funds **Loop Lab**, a nonprofit innovation and education hub powered by YieldLoop’s success.

YieldLoop turns modern automated trading into local economic advancement.  
Users earn; communities learn; everyone benefits.

# 1. Executive Summary

YieldLoop is an automated profit-generation engine built on Base, with cross-chain expansion planned. Users deposit fiat or crypto and receive automated trading performance powered by a controlled trading bot.

A verified performance fee of 25% applies to profit only:

- **10%** — Development & Operations  
- **5%** — Marketing & Partnerships  
- **5%** — Permanent System Deposit  
- **5%** — Loop Lab Nonprofit Funding  

**Loop Lab** converts a portion of platform success into real-world innovation, education, and prototyping.

YieldLoop is designed as a long-term, sustainable, self-reinforcing ecosystem.

# 2. System Overview

YieldLoop is a non-custodial, automated financial ecosystem. Users deposit digital or fiat assets into smart contracts that interface with the trading engine.

## Platform Structure

- All deposits are user-controlled (non-custodial).
- Smart contracts manage profit verification, compounding, and fee allocation.
- The system operates as a closed loop—profits strengthen the platform.

## Deposit & Trading Logic

- Minimum deposit: ~$50  
- Supported deposit types: **ETH, USDT, USD (fiat)**  
- Trading engine executes short-cycle trades on **BTC, ETH, BNB**  
- Profits trigger:
  - LOOP minting  
  - Fee allocation  
  - System reinvestment  
  - Loop Lab funding  

## User Profit Options

Users choose one of:

### 1. **Compound All**
100% of profits are redeposited.

### 2. **Split 50/50**
Half reinvested, half sent to the user.

### 3. **Collect All**
Full profits claimed immediately.

Profit handling is controlled on a 30-day cycle.

---

# 3. Performance Fee Model

YieldLoop charges **25% of verified profit only**. Never principal.

### Fee Split

| Allocation | % | Purpose |
|-----------|----|---------|
| Development & Team | 10% | Salaries, audits, upgrades |
| Marketing & Partnerships | 5% | User growth, referral rewards |
| System Deposit | 5% | Permanent platform compounding |
| Loop Lab (Nonprofit) | 5% | Community innovation funding |

### Automatic Distribution

On each profit cycle:

1. Smart contracts mint $LOOP.
2. User receives LOOP based on profit mode.
3. Fee is auto-distributed to allocation wallets.
4. System deposit is reinvested.
5. Loop Lab receives its share.

---

# 4. The Loop Lab Initiative

Loop Lab is the community innovation engine behind YieldLoop. It converts digital profit into physical opportunity.

## Mission

Bridge:

- technology  
- education  
- entrepreneurship  

Create a space where students, tradespeople, developers, and small businesses can prototype solutions.

## Structure

- Led by a **full-time Executive Director**
- Funded automatically via performance fee
- Operates as a nonprofit organization
- Supports training, workshops, hackathons, apprenticeships

## Funding Flow

- Receives **5% of YieldLoop performance fee**
- Used for:
  - staffing  
  - equipment  
  - student stipends  
  - grants  
  - sponsorship programs  

Loop Lab is the physical heartbeat of the YieldLoop ecosystem.

# 5. $LOOP Token Architecture

LOOP is a performance-backed utility token. It is only minted when **real, verified profit** exists.

## Minting Conditions

- LOOP is minted proportional to each user’s verified profit.
- No premine.
- No inflation.
- No speculative supply expansion.

## Backing & Redemption

Each LOOP token is redeemable for:

- ETH  
- USDT  
- Fiat equivalent  

LOOP maintains intrinsic value due to:

- Verified profit backing  
- System reinvestment  
- Controlled supply  
- Redemptions that tighten circulation  

## Circulation & Rising Floor

LOOP gains value as:

- Users compound (LOCKING supply)  
- System reinvests (INCREASING backing)  
- Users redeem (BURNING supply)  

This creates a rising intrinsic floor.

LOOP is designed as **proof of performance**, not speculation.

# 6. NFT Program – Founders Circle

YieldLoop introduces an optional NFT program for early supporters.

## Benefits

- Platform fee discounts
- Access to private channels
- Early access to new features
- Beta testing privileges
- Special Loop Lab access (workshops, events)
- Priority support

## Structure

# 7. Referral Program

YieldLoop offers a simple, transparent referral system.

## Structure

- Users receive a unique referral link.
- Referred users generate tracked activity.
- Referrer receives rewards funded by the **5% marketing/partnership allocation**.
- No pyramids, no stacking layers.

## Reward Model

Referral program is optional and non-essential to platform use.

---

# 8. Sustainability Model

YieldLoop’s sustainability is based on **verified trading performance**, not speculation or hypergrowth.

Key elements that maintain system health:

## 1. Verified Profit Minting  
LOOP is only minted when real profit exists.

## 2. No Presale / No Premine  
No artificial supply flooding.

## 3. System Deposit (5%)  
A portion of platform profit auto-compounds forever.

## 4. Controlled Redemptions  
Redemption burns supply and increases token scarcity.

## 5. Risk-Managed Trading  
The trading engine avoids leverage, avoids high-risk strategies, and focuses on controlled cycles.

## 6. Fee-Only-on-Profit Model  
No deposit fees.  
No withdrawal fees.  
No hidden fees.

## 7. Loop Lab Ecosystem  
Community growth increases platform longevity, visibility, and legitimacy.

# 9. Governance and Adjustability

YieldLoop governance ensures long-term system integrity.

## Adjustable Parameters

Governance may vote on:

- Trading engine settings  
- Performance fee %  
- Profit cycle length  
- NFT benefits  
- Referral structure  
- System deposit allocation  
- Loop Lab funding percentages  
- Risk-exposure limits  

Only a small set of parameters will be adjustable to prevent abuse.

## Who Governs?

# 10. Trading Engine

YieldLoop’s trading engine is the operational core of the system.

## Overview

- Executes automated trades on BTC, ETH, BNB  
- Uses short-cycle, low-volatility strategies  
- Avoids high leverage  
- Avoids long-hold exposure  
- Based on trend analysis and volatility compression  
- Generates frequent micro-profits

## Strategy Design

The engine focuses on:

- Micro-arbitrage  
- Spot volatility scalping  
- Momentum bursts  
- Short-window trend reversals  
- EMA / SMA-based signals  
- RSI compression windows  
- AI-assisted trend recognition  

## Profit Verification

A profit is considered “verified” when:

1. Trade closes in net positive value  
2. Platform fees are applied  
3. LOOP minting is triggered  
4. Distribution and reinvestment occur  
5. Transaction hash is stored  

## Risk Controls

- Max position size limits  
- Max daily trade count  
- Loss-protection thresholds  
- Market halt triggers  
- Circuit breakers  
- AI risk scoring  
- No user-level custody risk  

## User Cycle

Each user follows a **30-day loop**:

1. Deposit  
2. Trading engine runs  
3. Verified profit accumulates  
4. Cycle ends  
5. User receives profit in LOOP  
6. User selects next cycle mode  

The loop repeats automatically.

# 11. Security and Auditing

Security is the foundation of YieldLoop’s architecture.  
Every component—smart contracts, trading engine, signature flow, fee logic—is built with verifiability and user protection at the core.

## Smart Contract Audits

All contracts undergo external audits before launch.  
Audits confirm:

- Correct fee allocation  
- LOOP minting limits  
- Correct cycle and deposit flow  
- No unauthorized access paths  
- No external wallet control  
- Governance boundaries  
- Circuit breaker logic  

Auditors may include: **SourceHat**, **CertiK**, **Hacken**, **OpenZeppelin** (as optional secondary review).

Audit results will be posted publicly.

## Non-Custodial Structure

YieldLoop **cannot** move user funds without explicit approval signatures.

Users retain control at all times:

- Deposits stay in user-controlled contracts  
- Trading logic executes inside bounded smart-contract ranges  
- Withdrawals are user-triggered  
- No one can alter a user’s strategy after approval  

## Risk Mitigation Systems

YieldLoop uses:

- Stop-loss protections  
- Drawdown protection  
- Auto-pause in extreme volatility  
- Trade throttling during network congestion  
- Circuit breakers for anomalies  
- Minting locks if market conditions exceed thresholds  

## Transparency

All of the following are publicly viewable:

- Trade logs  
- Profit records  
- LOOP mint events  
- Fee distributions  
- Loop Lab funding wallet  
- NFT revenue wallets  
- Referral allocation logs  

A public dashboard will show:

- Real-time yield data  
- Performance charts  
- System-level metrics

# 12. Legal and Compliance

YieldLoop uses a compliance-responsible structure that protects users while maintaining decentralization.

## User-Controlled Deposits

YieldLoop is **non-custodial**:

- Users authorize strategies  
- Users sign deposit execution  
- No pooling of funds  
- No blind investments  

## Non-Security Positioning

YieldLoop is structured to avoid classification as a security.

### Key compliance points:

- Users configure their own strategy (active participant)  
- Users must approve settings before deposits  
- Fees apply to **performance of a tool**, similar to automated software  
- LOOP is minted only from **verified profit**, not speculation  
- Loop Lab is a **nonprofit**, not an investor benefit program  

## Fiat Compliance

Fiat deposits route through compliant payment partners who perform:

- KYC (Know Your Customer)  
- AML checks  
- Transaction screening  

YieldLoop does **not** store user identity information internally.

## Global Participation

Allowed everywhere except:

- Sanctioned regions  
- Jurisdictions explicitly banning DeFi or automated trading  
- Locations where derivatives/automated trading is restricted  

## Legal Disclaimer

YieldLoop provides **tools and automation**, not financial advice.  
Trading carries inherent risk.  
Users participate voluntarily and acknowledge potential loss.
